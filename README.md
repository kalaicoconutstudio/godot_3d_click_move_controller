# godot_3d_click_move_controller

## What is it?

This is a demo project of 3D clicking-moving controller in Godot Engine 3.2 by Kalaicoconut Studio, which contains a controller node you can reuse in any project with this kind of requirements.

## What can it do?

By clicking a certain kind of ojbect in the 3D world, you can navigate to the position defined by the ojbect, SMOOTHLY.

By clicking buttons, you can turn right or left by 90 or 180 degrees, SMOOTHLY.

## How to use it?

1. Make a folder in your project, and name it 'object'.
2. Copy Click3DFP.gd / Click3DFP.tscn / Click3DFPMoveSign / Click3DMoveSign_SignStaticBody.gd to the 'object' folder.
3. Creat a new scene and drag 'Click3DFP' in.
4. Add a Spatial node to the root node, and name it 'Click3DFPMoveSignGroup' or whatever you like.
5. Grag 'Click3DFPMoveSign' into that node you just created.
6. Grag more 'Click3DFPMoveSign' in the same way and place them around.

Now, run your scene.
